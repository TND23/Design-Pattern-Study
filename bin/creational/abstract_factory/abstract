Highest level explanation of a factory:
Caller tells factory to create object.

High level:
Caller communicates with factory, which then returns an implementation I of abstract class K.

Mid level:
An abstract factory defines the interface for all concrete factories that implement it.
These concrete factories implements the interface to create concrete objects, which are themselves implementations of one or more
abstract classes.



Useful if the system should not care about the objects are created or represented.
Hiding implementation details from a client and exposing only the interface.
